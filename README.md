> 6174 is known as Kaprekar's constant[1][2][3] after the Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar. This number is renowned for the following rule:

> 1. Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits (leading zeros are allowed).

> 3. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.
> 4. Go back to step 2 and repeat.
